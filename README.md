# Simulated Distributed Network
This is a simulated distributed network between 11 servers and 8 clients.
The network is based on a heavily modified version of the internet relay chat protocol.
It passes information along a spanning tree.
To run the program, download the files and then run the CRCTestManager.py file to run all of the test cases and show the different states and information being passed.
